# Using a model to predict the sales of products in the store

● For this project, BigMart Sales Data on Kaggle is used to process and build a forecast model. This data source collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities in 2013.

● Analysis and extraction of attributes that significantly impact product sales from the dataset, to be used in forecasting tasks.

● Application of commonly used evaluation criteria during machine learning model training, including cross-validation, confusion matrix, and F1-score.

● Using the main models in the problem are RandomForestRegressor and RandomizedSearchCV to predict sales of products sold. Evaluating forecast errors to improve the model for more accurate prediction results.
